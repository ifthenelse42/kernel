# Kernel
This is a repository for storing my kernel configurations running my multiple computers.

## Asus X206HA
The correct drivers to enable were found thanks to chrisoboe and his hard work just to help me get my laptop working on Gentoo with a fully customized kernel. The main difficulty were to find the correct drivers for obscure proprietary hardware that are made to work only on Windows. MANY thanks to chrisoboe.

## Asus Aspire ES1
Drivers were found by myself - thanks to teachings by, again, chrisoboe.

## Master
This is the kernel running my self-assembled computer, no difficulty here since there is no proprietary mystery driver to enable.
